		Steps to run the application:

Motion Detection usin the PIR sensor and Arduino

1) Open the tinkercad.com with your gmail account.
2) USe the new circuit tab to open new circuit for designing.
3) Use the starter circuits and search for lcd starter circuits
4) Place the starter ciruit in the working area.
5) change the setting of code to only text.
6) Connect the PIR sensor and Buzzer as per the circuit.
7) As per the video copy and past the code in the text sub-window.
8) check the connection once as per the code
9) Start the simulation and verify the results by placing the cursor on the PIR motion sensor.
10) For motion buzzer sound will come, for no motion, no sound will be from the buzzer.
